# Software Engineering - Programming Cheatsheet

Welcome all! This repo was built with the intent to be shared and to receive contributions from all developers, programmers, and software engineers of all experiences and levels. Please read below for more information!

## The What

The name says it all, this is essentially a one-stop resource/cheatsheet/study guide of sorts for anyone to refer to, whether they would like to know more about software engineering/computer programming or have a coding interview coming up. This resource is ideal for coding bootcamp students/grads who want to learn more or study up - but even someone without any programming knowledge can partake!!  

## The Why

As a junior developer who started his career through the unconventional path (self-taught/bootcamp > academia/university), I wanted to supplement my applicable knowledge with some deeper level understanding. So I started gathering common interview questions, explanations to basic programming concepts, and useful information on software engineering. The goal is to build a simple starter kit for those new to software engineering/programming.

## The How

I've organized this repo into chapters, each chapter is typically less than a 10 minute read through and has an assortment of information based on difficultly and fundamental significance. As you ascend through the chapters the information gradually becomes more difficult/complex with chapter 1 being the basic/fundamentally important. Each programming concept or interview question has a **brief** summary including a definition, explanation, and maybe an example or link to an additional resource. This will be as complex as it gets - I'll try to provide links for more complicated subjects if you'd like to read up on it but this cheatsheet is intended to be a brief summary and something you can review the night before an interview.
