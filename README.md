# Software Engineering - Programming Cheatsheet

Welcome all! This repo was built with the intent to be shared and to receive contributions from all developers, programmers, and engineers of all experiences and levels. Please read below for more information!

## What

The name says it all, this is essentially a study guide/cheatsheet of sorts for anyone to refer to whether they would like to know more about software engineering/computer programming, have an interview coming up, or just want to make the world a better place.

## Why

After horribly bombing a software engineering interview and going through a depressive period where I questioned my ability and skills to work in this field, I decided I wasn't going to just sit around and let life knock me down anymore. I decided to never let myself be that ignorant and unprepared, so I started gathering some useful information that any developer, programmer, engineer should know but for one reason or another do not know. 

## How

I've organized this repo to be as simple as possible, that means each programming concept has a brief definition, explanation, and maybe an example. To reiterate, this will be as complex as it gets - I'll try to provide links for more complicated subjects if you'd like to read up on it but this cheatsheet is intended to be a brief summary and something you can review the night before an interview.
